# SQL-STRING-OPERATION-PRACTICE
This project contains a collection of  30 SQL practice questions and solutions focused on string operations, data cleaning, and formatting  — essential skills for any aspiring Data Analyst.

## 📋 Overview
The project is built using a sample dataset named `user_profiles` within a database called `string_operation`.  
It covers multiple real-world SQL tasks such as text cleaning, case formatting, substring extraction, and pattern matching.

## 🗂️ Files Included
- **STRING_OPERATIONS.sql** — Contains SQL code for creating the table, inserting sample data, and executing 30+ string operation queries.
- **STRING_Questions.docx** — Lists all the practice questions included in this project.

## 🧩 Topics Covered
- **Basic String Manipulation** (TRIM, UPPER, LOWER, LENGTH)
- **Substring Extraction** (SUBSTRING, LEFT, RIGHT, SUBSTRING_INDEX)
- **Concatenation & Formatting** (CONCAT, REPLACE)
- **Pattern Matching** (LIKE, LOCATE)
- **Data Cleaning** (removing spaces, standardizing text)
- **Advanced Logic** (conditional extraction, counting spaces)

## 🧰 Tools Used
- MySQL (Recommended version: 8.0 or higher)
- Any SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, VS Code, DBeaver)

## 🎯 Purpose
This project was created to **strengthen SQL query-writing and data-cleaning skills** through hands-on exercises.  
It simulates common tasks a data analyst performs while preparing and transforming raw text data.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Run the script `STRING_OPERATIONS.sql` in your MySQL environment.
2. Review and modify queries as needed for additional practice.
3. Use `STRING_Questions.docx` as a guide to understand the purpose of each query.

## 🏁 Outcome
By completing these exercises, you’ll gain practical experience in:
- Writing efficient SQL string manipulation queries.
- Cleaning and standardizing messy datasets.
- Understanding real-world data preprocessing workflows.
